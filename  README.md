# Vigenère Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python program that uses the Vigenère cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages in the Ukrainian alphabet.

## How It Works

- **Encryption** shifts each letter in the message by a corresponding letter in the key.
- **Decryption** reverses the process to recover the original message.

The program includes a menu for users to choose between encrypting, decrypting, or exiting the program.

## Features

- Supports Ukrainian characters.
- Preserves non-alphabet characters (punctuation, numbers, spaces).
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
